# ModernX
A fork of mpvX (based on [mpv-osc-modern](https://github.com/maoiscat/mpv-osc-modern/)), that aims to mirror the functionality of MPV's stock OSC while with a more modern-looking interface.

# Additional Features

- Bug fixes to do with the volume slider
- Made elements being unavailable vs being turned off (audio tracks and subtitles) more distinguishable
- Fixes bugs to due with tooltips
- Added shift+left clicking and shift+right clicking the audio/subtitles button for a list of tracks are shown and traversed through
- Pressing TAB will now show a list of chapters
- Added dynamic title changing depending on the file/source being played
- Changed icon window x visibility range to prevent them from overlapping
- Many more configurable options

# Installation

Locate your MPV folder. It is typically located at `\%APPDATA%\mpv\` on Windows and `~/.config/mpv/` on Linux/MacOS. See the [Files section](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#files) in mpv's manual for more info.

Place `modernx.lua` into your mpv `scripts/` folder. Create the `scripts/` folder if you don't already have one and remove any other OSC scripts.

Then place the two fonts in the `fonts/` folder. `Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf` can be downloaded [Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf](Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf) and `Material-Design-Iconic-Round.ttf` also [Material-Design-Iconic-Round.ttf](Material-Design-Iconic-Round.ttf).


### mpv.conf
Add the following lines to your `mpv.conf` file.
```
osc = no
border = no # Optional, but recommended
```


### Border differences

This is what disabling and enablign the border looks like:

| Border Enabled | Border Disabled |
| -------------- | --------------- |

This option may vary depending on your system.


# Configuration

Create an `osc.conf` file and place it in the `script-opts/` folder (create the folder if you haven't already). A plethora options can be changed, so refer to the table of configurable `user_opts` parameters below for details.


### Example

Here is an example of a configuration file, in `script-opts/osc.conf`:

```
showloop=no

### Clips

Using the clip hotkey, one can use FFmpeg to mark a start and end of a clip

* `c` marks the clip, pressed again marks the end of the clip and called ffmpeg to make the clip.


### Compact Mode

Compact mode is a setting you can enable in the configuration, it removes the skip buttons, and places that functionality within the chapter buttons, allowing for more space in the interface. Clicking the buttons will act as jumping, and shift clicking will act as skipping a chapter

| Compact Mode Enabled | Compact Mode Disabled |

This changes the actions of the playlist back/forward buttons in the following way:

* `Left mouse button` jumps forwards/backwards by 5 seconds, or by the amount set in `user_opts`
* `Right mouse button` jumps forwards/backwards by 1 minute
* `Shift + Left mouse button` play previous/next file and show playlist
* `Shift + Right mouse button` show playlist

Please note that this option will override the `showjump` option.

### Thumbnails
